A. The first image shows a map of Puerto Rico with TGs which were active during Hurricane Maria; The second image shows the SSH time series for ECCO and all TGs a month before, during the dates of, and a month after Hurricane Maria.
B. Bland Altman plots showing the agreement of SSH data between ECCO and TG sources for Arecibo, Esperanza, Isabel Segunda and Mayaguez TGs.
C. SSH data time series where ECCO and TGs intersect for the entire period when the TGs were active.
D. SSH rolling mean of the time series for each TG and ECCO
E. SSH rolling standard deviation of the time series for each TG and ECCO
F. Pearson's correlation coefficients and P-values obtained from the SSH time series rolling mean and rolling standard deviation between ECCO and TG, for each TG
